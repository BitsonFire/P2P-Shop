P2P-Shop Project is an attempt to create a Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Shopping Application from scratch.
It was built using Python with web sockets and multithreading along with an accompanying gui built with Tkinter.

This is an academic project created to demonstrate the networking and multithreading concepts.

The application can be run with the following command.
```
python3 GUI.py
```
Please ensure that you have installed the Tkinter library before starting the application.
